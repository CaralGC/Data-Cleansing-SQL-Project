# Data-Cleansing-SQL-Project
The main objective of this project is to clean data in SQL. The data includes information about housing sale dates, addresses, owner names, value, size, etc.

Objectives
- Standardize SaleDate column format.
- Populate PropertyAddress column.
- Split PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress into individual columns (Address, City, State).
- Change 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in SoldAsVacant column.
- Remove duplicates.
- Delete unused columns.

Some of the functions used include: ALTER TABLE - ADD - DROP COLUMN, DELETE, UPDATE - SET, JOIN, CASE - WHEN - THEN - ELSE, CTE, etc.

After all this data cleaning process, the data is much easier to work with because it is now in a more suitable format.
